# Results
This repository contains all the results of testing for mixed-reality framework.
The results are classified according to the data-sources (if the real images are from KITTI-Dataset or from ZED2, and if the virtual images are from Gazebo or Unity).
Also there are the results of the fusion of two images and the result of the object detection applied to the fusion.
